The total number of military and civilian casualties in World War I was more than 41 million. DAMN!! Thats a lot of people. May they always be remembered.
The first world war began in August 1914. It was directly triggered by the assassination of the Austrian archduke, Franz Ferdinand and his wife by a Bosnian revolutionary Gavrilo Princip, on 28th June 1914.
